paths:
  pred_forest_path: 'data/pipeline/L1W/results/full_forest/L1W.laz' # path to predicted forest point cloud
  gt_forest_path: 'data/benchmark/L1W_voxelized01_for_eval.laz' # path to ground truth forest point cloud

thresholds:
  min_iou_for_match: 0.5 # minimum pointwise iou between predicted and ground truth tree for hungarian matching (>> 0 required to prevent zero iou matching)
  min_precision_for_pred: 0.5 # sum over all i of precision(prediction, ground_truth_i) must be larger than min_precision_for_pred for an unmatched prediction to count as commission error (oversegmentation or heavy undersegmentation)
  # Otherwise it might just be a separate tree prediction (maybe a smaller tree) that was not annotated in the ground truth.
  min_recall_for_gt: 0.5 # max over all i of recall(prediction_i, ground_truth) must be larger than min_recall_for_gt for an unmatched ground truth to have a corresponding prediction (most likely undersegmentation)
  # Otherwise, the ground truth tree was most likely not detected at all. This is not relevant to calculate the ommission error and was not mentioned in the paper.
  # However, it can be used to pair unmatched ground truth trees with predictions for visualization purposes.
